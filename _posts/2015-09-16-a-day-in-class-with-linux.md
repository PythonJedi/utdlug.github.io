title: A Day in Class With Linux
---

### Saturday September 16, 2015 / 5-8PM ECSS 2.203

Have you ever wanted to install Linux but didn't because of schoolwork?  Are you unsure if you can complete your classes with a Linux computer?  Join the LUG to see how Linux can make your classwork easier and faster to complete.

We'll cover topics such as:

  * Type-setting documents with LaTeX
  * Compiling code with g++ and javac
  * Opening and editing MS Office documents
  * Advanced mathematics with octave
  * Netflix & YouTube
  * Electronic Note Software

See if you can stump us by bringing in some idea or task that you do during a *normal* class day (note: gaming during class is highly frowned upon).
