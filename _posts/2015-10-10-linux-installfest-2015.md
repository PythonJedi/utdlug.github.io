---

### Saturday October 10th, 2015 / 4-8PM ECSS 2.201

An Installfest is a fun and exciting event where experienced and novice Linux users get together to install Linux on their computers, answering questions and giving help where needed. Bring your laptop to our Installfest, where we will guide you through the process of safely installing Ubuntu Linux in a virtual machine, along with basic Linux usage.  By the end, you will be prepared to explore all that is Linux.
